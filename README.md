# Employee-management-system using JavaFX
This is a simple Employee Management System built using JavaFX and JDBC. The application allows users to input employee details such as employee ID, name, age, email, and department. Users can then create an employee table, register new employees, view the list of registered employees, and update employee information based on Employee ID.
